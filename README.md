## 🧠 Research Identity

I build intelligent systems that learn through interaction and simulation.  
My work focuses on bridging reinforcement learning, behavioral modeling, and real-world decision systems to create AI that adapts dynamically rather than relying on static prediction.

I am particularly interested in designing environments where learning emerges from structured uncertainty.

## 🧭 Technical Philosophy

I believe meaningful AI systems emerge from:

- Strong problem framing before modeling  
- Simulation before prediction  
- Systems thinking over isolated models  
- Interpretability as a first-class concern  
- Designing for uncertainty rather than avoiding it  

My goal is to build AI systems that behave robustly in complex environments rather than optimizing solely for benchmark performance.
